This is a compilations of machine learning models built to learn how to recognize legitimate and fraudulant credit card transactions from an unbalacaed data set.
The data set being used to train the model is heavily skweed towards legitimate transactions and so training it to recognize fraudulant transactions using regular means is more difficult.
This model bridges that gap and detects fraudulant transactions with a very high accuracy
Multiple ML models are bieng used to contrast and compare reults
This model is built to be adjusted to any data set! Feel free to tinker and let me know if it has any problems!
I was lazy about the visualization! but I included multiple histograms!

Instructions on set up
- Data set from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data)
